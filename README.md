# What To Wear (WTWR)

## WTWR (OverView)
WTWR is an application that assists users in what to wear depending on the current weather. The application contains clothing options and based on the weather it will suggest.

## WTWR (Functionality)
WTWR is an application that utilizes a weather API. With this API, the user is able to get their local temperature. The application then takes the temperature and filters clothing options for the user. 

## What To Come
WTWR is far from done. Coming up soon is a dynamic interface to adjust for multiple screen sizes.
